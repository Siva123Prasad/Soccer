Some key insights into the soccer world from 2008 to 2016.

The data used here is from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer">kaggle</a>. The data file is too big to be uploaded here.

Following which, I have used python to derive insights from it.

I have converted the solutions ipynb file into html and uploaded it here.
